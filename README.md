## Overview

Hidden Geometry Removal is a powerful Blender add-on that automatically identifies and removes geometry that cannot be seen from any viewing angle. This tool is perfect for optimizing 3D models for real-time applications, game engines, or web-based 3D viewers. **Important: Only merged objects can properly delete inside/hidden meshes** - the addon includes built-in mesh merging functionality to handle this requirement efficiently.

## Features

- 🎥 Intelligent camera placement using spherical distribution
- 🔄 Customizable number of viewing angles
- ⚡ High-precision geometry analysis
- 🎯 Support for both deletion and selection modes
- 🛠️ User-friendly interface
- 📷 Option to keep cameras for visualization
- 🧪 Experimental mode with randomized face selection
- 📊 Configurable face sampling and flatness threshold
- 🔗 Built-in mesh merging functionality for proper internal geometry removal

## Installation

1. Download the latest release (`HiddenGeometryRemoval.py`)
2. Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`
3. Click `Install` and select the downloaded file
4. Enable the add-on by checking the box

## Usage

1. Select your mesh object in the 3D viewport
2. Open the sidebar (`N` key) and find the "Hidden Removal" tab
3. Adjust the settings:
   - **Merge Meshes**: Enable to combine all meshes (required for proper internal geometry removal)
   - **Merge by Distance**: Option to merge vertices that are close to each other
   - **Number of Rows**: Controls the number of vertical camera splines around the object
   - **Cameras per Row**: Sets how many cameras are placed along each spline
   - **Camera Distance**: Adjusts how far cameras are from the object's center
   - **Delete/Select Mode**: Choose between removing hidden geometry or selecting visible faces
   - **Precision**: Toggle between high and low precision analysis
   - **Keep Cameras**: Option to retain cameras in a 'Cameras' collection for visualization
   - **Experimental Mode**: Enable advanced face selection techniques
4. Click "Remove Hidden Geometry" to process your mesh

## How It Works

The add-on creates a spherical distribution of cameras around your object using:
- Vertical splines (rows) evenly distributed around the object
- Multiple camera positions along each spline
- Automatic camera positioning and targeting
- Ray-casting for visibility checks

For proper internal geometry removal, the add-on first merges all selected meshes into a single object. This ensures that occluded geometry within complex models (like interior walls or internal components) can be properly identified and removed.

## Settings Explained

### Mesh Processing
- **Merge Meshes**: When enabled, all mesh objects in the scene are combined before processing
- **Merge by Distance**: Cleans up the mesh by merging vertices that are very close to each other

### Camera Distribution
- **Rows**: More rows = more thorough horizontal coverage
  - Minimum: 2
  - Maximum: 12
  - Default: 4

- **Cameras per Row**: More cameras = better vertical coverage
  - Minimum: 2
  - Maximum: 12
  - Default: 4
  - Must be even number

### Processing Options
- **High Precision**: Checks vertices and edge midpoints (slower but more accurate)
- **Low Precision**: Only checks face centers (faster but less precise)
- **Keep Cameras**: When enabled, cameras are kept in a 'Cameras' collection for visualization and debugging

### Experimental Mode Options
- **Face Sampling Ratio**: Percentage of faces to randomly sample for visibility check
  - Minimum: 1%
  - Maximum: 100%
  - Default: 30%
- **Flatness Angle**: Maximum angle difference for considering faces similar
  - Minimum: 10°
  - Maximum: 90°
  - Default: 30°

## Best Practices

1. **Always Enable Mesh Merging**: To properly remove internal geometry, keep the "Merge Meshes" option enabled
2. **Camera Distance**: Set it larger than your object's maximum dimension
3. **Number of Cameras**: Start with default values and increase if needed
4. **Precision Mode**: Use 'High' for final processing, 'Low' for testing
5. **Backup**: Always save your file before processing large models
6. **Visualization**: Enable 'Keep Cameras' option to understand camera placement for complex cases

## Performance Tips

- Start with lower settings for large meshes
- Use 'Outer Select' mode to preview what will be removed
- Increase camera count gradually until desired results are achieved
- Disable 'Keep Cameras' for faster processing on large scenes

## Limitations

- Works best with manifold geometry
- Processing time increases with camera count and mesh complexity
- Very small details might require higher camera counts to detect

## Experimental Features

The experimental mode allows for:
- Randomized face sampling to reduce processing time
- Similar face detection based on normal angle
- More flexible and adaptive geometry removal
